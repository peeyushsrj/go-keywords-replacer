# go-keywords-replacer
Replace keywords in files! (recursively inside folders too!)

Put keywords to replace in `old.txt` with new keywords `new.txt`.

Build yours, or download binaries from Releases! Put the executable file, `old.txt` and `new.txt` in the folder where you want to replace keywords. Then run executable.
